# Minion

Minion is a top of the line state of the art programming language designed for minions like you.

## Features
- **Easy to remember variables:** All variable names must contain the name of a minion from our official and specially curated [minion name list](https://github.com/Leastrio/minion/blob/main/src/minions.rs)
- **Short and simple file extension:** Minion lang source files all end with `.gru`, paying homage to our master Gru
- **Minionlib:** A comphrehensive library of standard top of the line functions for all of your villainous needs

## Example
```
let bob = 5;
let kevin = 7;

let stuart = fn(tim, dave) {
    return tim * dave;
}

bello(stuart(bob, kevin));
```

## Getting Started
To get started clone this repo and run `cargo run`! This will put you in a repl for easy running of minion lang code.
